# ResourcesM
Resources M is a compilation of all of the resources I've developed for FiveM, you can use these fully as you wish, although some may not function properly.

# Anti-VDM
This Anti-VDM script can be used in servers to tackle the problem of trolls and people trying to mass kill with the use of vehicles, to edit how much damage the vehicles do, open antivdm-c.lua and edit the 0.0 value to what damage multiplier you want, it goes from 0.0-1.0, 0.5 being half the normal damage vehicles do. To activate the script for use in the server, add this whole /antivdm/ folder into your server resources and make sure the 'antivdm' resource is started with the server.

# Discord Chat Command
This command is simple to get your head around, you do '/discord' in the FiveM chat and it appears with your Discord server link. To replace the example text with your server link, open the discord-c.lua file and replace the discord link on the second line inside of the brackets and quotation marks. Once you have done this, place the whole /discord/ folder into your server resources and make sure the 'discord' resource is started on startup of your server. If this malfunctions, then in the server you can restart the resource with 'restart discord'.

# Speedometer and Speedlimiter
This resource adds a simple Speedometer and Speedlimiter, no changes are needed to the code so just place the /speedometer/ folder in your server resources and make sure the 'speedometer' resource is started up with the server.

# Reduce Lag (Reduces Pedestrians and Traffic)
This resource reduces the pedestrians and traffic by around 40 percent. This resource may not work properly if you have any other resources that change the properties of the pedestrians and traffic. No changes are needed to the code so just place the /reduceserverlag/ folder in your server resources and make sure the 'reduceserverlag' resource is started up with the server.

# Health
This resource regens the players health to the max. It is suggested you edit this resource a bit to make it an admin or trusted persons only command. No changes are needed to the code so just place the /health/ folder in your server resources and make sure the 'health' resource is started up with the server.
